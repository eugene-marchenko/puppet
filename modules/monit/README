= PUPPET MODULE:
  monit

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'monit' : }
include monit

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'monit' : installed => false }

# Monitor service foo

monit::monitor::service { 'foo' : }

# Do not monitor service foo

monit::monitor::service { 'foo' : ensure => false }

# Service foo has different init script

monit::monitor::service { 'foo' : initscript => '/etc/init.d/baz' }

# Service foo has non-standard pid

monit::monitor::service { 'foo' : pidfile => '/var/run/foo/bar/baz.pid' }

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.

Note that the monit::monitor::service includes the monit class so you do
not necessarily need to include it explicitly, unless you wish to do so for
readability.
