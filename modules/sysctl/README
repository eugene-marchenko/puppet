= PUPPET MODULE:
  sysctl

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'sysctl' : }
include sysctl

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'sysctl' : installed => false }

# Set some sysctl options

sysctl::option { 'net.core.rmem_max' : value => '16777216' }
sysctl::option { 'net.core.wmem_max' : value => '16777216' }

Would create the following files on the node:
- /etc/sysctl.d/60-net.core.rmem_max.conf
- /etc/sysctl.d/60-net.core.wmem_max.conf

And would then call Exec['service procps start'] to apply those options.

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.

The sysctl class should be included by default on a node in order for the
sysctl::service[sysctl-services] define to be created which the sysctl::option
define notifies. This is simply:

node 'foo' {
  include sysctl
  sysctl::option { 'foo' : value => 'bar' }
}
