= PUPPET MODULE:
  ssh

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. May work on other platforms, esp Ubuntu/Debian.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { ssh : }

# Uninstalled (but not purged)

class { ssh : ensure => uninstalled }

# Uninstalled (and purged)

class { ssh : 
  ensure => uninstalled, 
  purged => true
}

# Installed and configs are managed by augeas

class { ssh : 
  ensure => installed, 
  augeas_managed => true
}

# Simple augeas management of one option

ssh::config { 'PasswordAuthentication' : 
  config  => {
    'PasswordAuthentication'   => {
      ensure  => present,
      file    => '/etc/ssh/sshd_config',
      value   => $::ipaddress_lo,
      require => Class[ssh],
      notify  => Class[ssh::service],
  }
}

# Augeas management of multiple options

ssh::config { [ 'Host[. = \'*\']/ForwardAgent', 'Host[. = \'*\' ]/ForwardX11' ] : 
  config  => {
    'Host[. = \'*\']/ForwardAgent' => {
      ensure  => present,
      file    => '/etc/ssh/ssh_config',
      value   => "yes",
      require => Class[ssh],
    },
    'Host[. = \'*\']/ForwardX11'    => {
      ensure  => present,
      file    => '/etc/ssh/ssh_config',
      value   => "yes"
      require => Class[ssh],
    },
  }
}

# Management of files using templates, filebuckets or symlinks

class { ssh : 
  ensure => installed, 
  configfiles => {
    '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'  => {
      mode  => '0644',
      content => template('ssh/sshd_config_bastion.erb')
      require => Class[ssh::package],
      notify  => Class[ssh::service],
    },
    '/etc/ssh/ssh_config'   => {
      mode    => '0644',
      content => puppet:///modules/ssh/ssh_config_bastion,
      require => Class[ssh::package],
    },
    '/etc/defaultssh'       => {
      mode    => '0644',
      require => Class[ssh::package],
      notify  => Class[ssh::service],
    },
    '/root/.ssh/config'     => {
      ensure  => 'link',
      mode    => '0600',
      owner   => 'root',
      group   => 'root',
      target  => '/etc/ssh/ssh_config',
    },
  },
}

== CAVEATS:

The default ssh install will choose to manage the ssh config file.
In order to manage the file with ssh::config which wraps augeas, you
will need to set augeas_managed => true as a parameter to the ssh class.
