= PUPPET MODULE:
  sasl

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'sasl' : }
include sasl

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'sasl' : installed => false }

# Installing sasl users

# Simple install

sasl::user { 'relay' : password => 'kn0ckkn0ck' }

# With different dbfile

sasl::user { 'relay' :
  password  => 'kn0ckkn0ck',
  dbfile    => '/var/spool/postfix/etc/sasldb',
}

# With a different domain

sasl::user { 'relay' :
  password  => 'kn0ckkn0ck',
  mx_domain => 'relay.example.com',
}

# Remove a user

sasl::user { 'relay' : ensure => false, password 'kn0ckkn0ck' }

# Remove a user with a custom domain

sasl::user { 'relay' :
  ensure    => false,
  password  => 'kn0ckkn0ck',
  mx_domain => 'relay.example.com',
}

== CAVEATS:

If postfix is installed, Class[sasl] will add the postfix user to the sasl
group. It WILL NOT change the dbfile path in either the sasl::user define OR
in the sasl_configs Hash in sasl::params. This is because postfix could be
configured as NOT chrooted, even though on Debian systems is is by default.

It will ONLY change the values in the sasl_configs Hash IF the postfix_chroot
fact is available AND it will prepend those file paths with the VALUE of the
postfix_chroot fact. The value of the dbfile parameter in sasl::user define
will be prepended with the value of the postfix_chroot fact as well.

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.
