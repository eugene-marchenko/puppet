= PUPPET MODULE:
  resolver

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'resolver' : }
include resolver

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'resolver' : installed => false }

You can modify what goes in resolv.conf by either creating a new
class which can specify the following variables:
- resolver_domainname (String)
- resolver_searchpath (String)
- resolver_nameservers (Array)

MAKE SURE THOSE VARIABLES ARE IN THE SAME SCOPE AS THE CLASS THAT IS RENDERING
THE TEMPLATE!

OR

You can assign to the system custom facts with the above names. This might
be a simpler option, especially since this module requires puppetlabs/stdlib
which has the facter_dot_d custom fact plugin which queries
/etc/facter/facts.d/facts.yaml

So you could just create that file with the following:

---
resolver_domainname: foo.com
resolver_searchpath: foo.com bar.com
resolver.nameservers: 18.72.0.3 18.71.0.151

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.
