= PUPPET MODULE:
  users

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. May work on other platforms, esp Ubuntu/Debian.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'users' : }
include users

# Absent

class { 'users' : ensure => 'absent' }

# Use external data

class { 'users' : override => true }

# Install multiple user types

class { 'users' : users => [ 'sysadmins', 'developers' ] }

# Default install but install additional users

include users
users::manage { 'developers' : }
users::manage { 'contractors' : }

== CAVEATS:

Use the underlying defines at your own discretion. They do the heavy lifting
but much of the input checking comes further up the chain in users::manage
define and the init.pp
