= PUPPET MODULE:
  route53

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. May work on other platforms, esp Ubuntu/Debian.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'route53' : }
include route53

# Use external data

class { 'route53' : files => hiera('some_other_route53_files') }

# Set the service to not be enabled in the init runlevels

class { 'route53' : enable => false }

# Set the service to not be run from puppet

class { 'route53' : run => false }

== CAVEATS:

This currently only manages DNS records of type CNAME and A. This module
is really only meant for taking a node's hostname and address and adding
them to the route53 zone that matches the node's domain name. All other
route53 related record management is not currently supported.

There are two facts that must exist on the system for this to run. They are:

route53_aws_access_key
route53_aws_secret_access_key
