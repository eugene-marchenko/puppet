= PUPPET MODULE:
  postfix

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'postfix' : }
include postfix

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'postfix' : installed => false }

# You can manage the postfix config through either a custom class which sets
# necessary variables or through custom facts added to
# /etc/facter/facts.d/facts.yaml

# For example, the following facts
postfix_hostname: open-relay
postfix_mynetworks: 0.0.0.0/0
postfix_inet_interfaces: all

Would result in the following lines in main.cf

myhostname = open-relay
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
inet_interfaces = all

Which would open up your postfix install to spammers, obviously a bad thing.

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.
