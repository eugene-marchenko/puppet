= PUPPET MODULE:
  cron

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'cron' : }
include cron

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'cron' : installed => false }

# Install custom crontab

cron::crontab { 'remove_backups':
  command => 'find /var/backups -type f -mtime +7 | xargs rm -f',
}

Would output to /etc/cron.d/remove_backups:
56 6 * * * root find /var/backups -type f -mtime +7 | xargs rm -f

You can modify the intervals the job runs, the user it runs as, add additional
comments, add ENV vars via optional parameters.

To change it to run every 5 minutes from 6am-7am every day,

cron::crontab { 'remove_backups':
  command => 'find /var/backups -type f -mtime +7 | xargs rm -f',
  minute  => '*/5',
}

Et cetera.

== TODO:

Add support for /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.monthly

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.
