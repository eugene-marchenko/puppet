= PUPPET MODULE:
  solr

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'solr' : }
include solr

# The AntiClass pattern

class { 'solr' : installed => false }

== CAVEATS:

May work on other platforms. Only tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Currently
Ubuntu/Debian is only explicitly supported vi the params.pp. You can add other
OS support via that class.

If you want Solr to notify the servlet engine (currently supported Jetty or
Tomcat) you will need to add the notify relationship at the level including
both Solr and Jetty/Tomcat.

For example:

node 'search' {
  include jetty
  include jetty::service
  include solr
  Class[solr] ~> Class[jetty::service]
}
