= PUPPET MODULE:
  ruby

== REQUIREMENTS:

=== Platform and Application Environment:

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. May work on other platforms, esp Ubuntu/Debian.

== USAGE:

# Simple default install

class { 'ruby' : }
include ruby

# Use external data for gem packages

class { 'ruby' : packages => hiera('some_other_packages') }

# Change the list of packages to install

class { 'ruby' : packages => [ 'other_package', 'another_package' ] }

# Ensure the packages are not installed

class { 'ruby' : installed => false }

# In addition to the packages installed by the ruby init class, there
# is an additional define where you can install arbitrary ruby packages
# and then chain them via Resource Chaining to define the order they are
# installed

class { 'ruby': }
ruby::package { 'foo': provider => 'gem', ensure => '0.3.0' }
ruby::package { 'bar': provider => 'gem', ensure => 'latest' }

Class[ruby]         -> Ruby::Package[foo]
Ruby::Package[foo]  -> Ruby::Package[bar]

== CAVEATS:

Currently no way to uninstall the packages. That is hard coded as installed.
To uninstall gem packages, you'll have to modify the define and set ensure to
'absent' for gem packages and/or 'purged' for apt ruby packages since the apt
provider supports purging.
